# f1_game
A Formula 1 prediction game where you try to get the lowest score by most accurately predicting the finishing order of the 20 drivers on the grid over a season

It takes the list of drivers from the official Formula 1 website and compares it against player entries. For each place difference, a point is added to the player's score.
(Example: A player predicts Max Verstappen will finish the season in 3rd place, but he actually finishes in 1st. 3-1 = 2, therefore 2 points are added to the player's score.)
The player with the lowest score wins.
